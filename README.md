# GRID_OS

### Description
GRID_OS is a free and open-source operating system created by BLACKGRID to give users control without sacrificing usability. Built on the Linux kernel, it is designed for Desktop and Mobile platforms that share a unified foundation and philosophy. GRID_OS exists to challenge the idea that clean, seamless experiences must come from closed ecosystems. Its mission is to combine intuitive design with openness, software freedom, and cross-platform compatibility. By supporting Linux, Android, and select iOS workflows, GRID_OS aims to reduce fragmentation, empower users, and build a long-lasting operating system that serves people rather than platforms.

### What Inspired The Project
GRID_OS was created by BLACKGRID founder Joshua Schumacher with the goal of delivering a free and open source operating system that bridges the gap between desktop and mobile computing. Built on the Linux kernel, GRID_OS is designed to be fully transparent and free from surveillance, with source code that is completely open and auditable. The platform aims to provide a seamless user experience comparable to established operating systems such as Android and iOS, while maintaining user freedom, control, and privacy.
